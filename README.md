## TONY STARK (IRON MAN) 

In the words of Tony Stark:
> I'm a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist

[Anthony "Tony" Stark](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Anthony_Stark_(Earth-616)) was born to a family that owned *Stark Industries*, a defense company that develops and manufactures various defense technologies and advanced weaponry. 

At the age of ~~17~~ **15**, he entered MIT to study electrical engineering, and he received graduate masters degrees in electrical engineering and physics. 

After his parents are killed in a car accident, he inherits the company and lives the billionaire playboy lifestyle. 

Being forced to escape from a hostile kidnapping situation, Tony with the help of a physicist creates an Iron Man suit to escape. 

With his newfound power and motivation for justice, Tony develops a persona that is justice-seeking, and he juggles his two personas: **_Tony Stark_, the egotistical and wildly successful man, and _Iron Man_, the selfless and justice-seeking hero.** 
  
- More than 53 suits (he can fly!) 
- He has direct access to A.I. (Jarvis) 
- He fights crimes and saves lives. (He's a hero!) 


Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.  
No. 

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
1.5 hours 

On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?
3, because I had to read over the exact syntax and ask questions to find out how to create a new directory. 

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
I wasn't able to create a new directory in this github platform. I could make new .txt files, but not a new directory. 
Perhaps creating less rules and asking the students to create a short poem with different visual writing formats would've been interesting, as it allows students to be more creative in their results.
