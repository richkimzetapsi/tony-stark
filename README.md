## TONY STARK (IRON MAN) 

In the words of Abraham Lincoln:
> Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist

[Anthony "Tony" Stark](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Anthony_Stark_(Earth-616)) was born to a family that owned *Stark Industries*, a defense company that develops and manufactures various defense technologies and advanced weaponry. 

At the age of ~~17~~ **15**, he entered MIT to study electrical engineering, and he received graduate masters degrees in electrical engineering and physics. 

After his parents are killed in a car accident, he inherits the company and lives the billionaire playboy lifestyle. 

Being forced to escape from a hostile kidnapping situation, Tony with the help of a physicist creates an Iron Man suit to escape. 

With his newfound power and motivation for justice, Tony develops a persona that is justice-seeking, and he juggles his two personas: **_Tony Stark_, the egotistical and wildly successful man, and _Iron Man_, the selfless and justice-seeking hero.** 
  
- More than 53 suits (he can fly!) 
- He has direct access to A.I. (Jarvis) 
- He fights crimes and saves lives. (He's a hero!)
